            which supervised its academic programs and awarded degrees.

            it changed its name to <b>University of Ghana</b> in 1961, when it gained full university status.

            basic science, agriculture and medicine. However, as part of the national educational reform program, the university curriculum was expanded to 
            provide more technology-based and vocational courses as we as postgraduate training.
